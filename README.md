# ISquash
WiC-Hacks Game

Hello! We are the Super Cool Hacker Group!
We want to introduce you to our super cool game, iSquash.

iSquash is an interactive game where you can choose to be a squash player or just be a part of the crowd. 
And just because you are a part of the crowd doesn’t mean that you won’t have any influence, because YOU WILL. 
The crowd plays a pivotal role in iSquash where they can react with yays and boos to the player/players of their choosing. 
This affects the player/players overall performance. Did I tell you that you can also throw squashes? 
WELL YOU CAN!


### How to play:

First, You will first choose if you want to become a player of the squash game or a member of the crowd.

If you choose to be a player, traditional rules of squash apply, plus you are able to react to your opponent/opponents as if you
were a part of the crowd.

If you are not familiar with the rules of squash you can catch up here:
In squash, players can score points when they hit the ball in a way that their opponent cannot return it before it bounces 
twice on the floor or hits the out-of-bounds marker, this is a rally. 
If a player hits the ball out-of-bounds or blocks their opponent’s access to the ball this will result in a fault. 
Whoever commits a fault, the opponent is given the point. If the fault is a block, the opponent is awarded a penalty stroke. 
Finally, a let occurs when the game is stopped due to an interference, obstruction, or safety concern.

If you choose to be part of the crowd, you will be able to react to individual players of the actual squash game. These reactions
will have affects on the player they are directed to. (expand)
Reactions include: cheering them on with a YAY, indicating frustration with a BOO, and expressing utter disapproval by actually
throwing a squash, and you can just imagine what throwing a squash would do to a player's ego and health points;;

Additionally, bets can be placed on the players with the squashes given at the start of the game.
All players and crowd members start off with a total of 50 squashes at the beginning of the game, these squashes can be used to 
place bets on a most favorite player or used to thrown at a despised player.
